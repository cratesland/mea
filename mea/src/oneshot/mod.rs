// This implementation is derived from the `oneshot` crate [1], with significant simplifications
// since mea needs not support synchronized receiving functions.
//
// [1] https://github.com/faern/oneshot/blob/25274e99/src/lib.rs

//! A one-shot channel is used for sending a single message between
//! asynchronous tasks. The [`channel`] function is used to create a
//! [`Sender`] and [`Receiver`] handle pair that form the channel.
//!
//! The `Sender` handle is used by the producer to send the value.
//! The `Receiver` handle is used by the consumer to receive the value.
//!
//! Each handle can be used on separate tasks.
//!
//! Since the `send` method is not async, it can be used anywhere. This includes
//! sending between two runtimes, and using it from non-async code.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! use mea::oneshot;
//!
//! let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
//!
//! tokio::spawn(async move {
//!     if let Err(_) = tx.send(3) {
//!         println!("the receiver dropped");
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! match rx.await {
//!     Ok(v) => println!("got = {:?}", v),
//!     Err(_) => println!("the sender dropped"),
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! If the sender is dropped without sending, the receiver will fail with
//! [`RecvError`]:
//!
//! ```
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! use mea::oneshot;
//!
//! let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel::<u32>();
//!
//! tokio::spawn(async move {
//!     drop(tx);
//! });
//!
//! match rx.await {
//!     Ok(_) => panic!("This doesn't happen"),
//!     Err(_) => println!("the sender dropped"),
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
