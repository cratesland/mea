//! # Mea - Make Easy Async
//!
//! `mea` is a runtime-agnostic library providing essential synchronization primitives for
//! asynchronous Rust programming. The library offers a collection of well-tested, efficient
//! synchronization tools that work with any async runtime.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * [`Barrier`] - A synchronization point where multiple tasks can wait until all participants
//!   arrive
//! * [`Latch`] - A single-use barrier that allows one or more tasks to wait until a signal is given
//! * [`Mutex`] - A mutual exclusion primitive for protecting shared data
//! * [`Semaphore`] - A synchronization primitive that controls access to a shared resource
//! * [`WaitGroup`] - A synchronization primitive that allows waiting for multiple tasks to complete
//!
//! ## Runtime Agnostic
//!
//! All synchronization primitives in this library are runtime-agnostic, meaning they can be used
//! with any async runtime like Tokio, async-std, or others. This makes the library highly versatile
//! and portable.
//!
//! ## Thread Safety
//!
//! All types in this library implement `Send` and `Sync`, making them safe to share across thread
//! boundaries. This is essential for concurrent programming where data needs to be accessed from
//! multiple threads.
//!
//! [`Barrier`]: barrier::Barrier
//! [`Latch`]: latch::Latch
//! [`Mutex`]: mutex::Mutex
//! [`Semaphore`]: semaphore::Semaphore
//! [`WaitGroup`]: waitgroup::WaitGroup
