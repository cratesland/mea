/// RAII structure used to release the shared read access of a lock when dropped, for a mapped
/// component of the locked data.
///
/// This structure is created by the [`map`] and [`filter_map`] methods on [`RwLockReadGuard`]. It
/// allows you to hold a read lock on a subfield of the protected data, enabling more fine-grained
/// access control while maintaining the same locking semantics.
///
/// As long as you have this guard, you have shared read access to the underlying `T`. The guard
/// internally keeps a reference to the original rwlock's semaphore, so the original lock is
/// maintained until this guard is dropped.
///
/// `MappedRwLockReadGuard` implements [`Send`] and [`Sync`] when `T: Sync`, allowing it to be
/// used across task boundaries and shared between threads safely. Note that [`Send`] does not
/// require `T: Send` because the read guard only borrows the data rather than owning it.
///

/// [`filter_map`]: crate::rwlock::RwLockReadGuard::filter_map
