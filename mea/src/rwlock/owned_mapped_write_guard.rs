/// Owned RAII structure used to release the exclusive write access of a lock when dropped, for a
/// mapped component of the locked data.
///
/// This guard is only available from a [`RwLock`] that is wrapped in an [`Arc`]. It is similar to
/// [`MappedRwLockWriteGuard`], except that rather than borrowing the `RwLock`, it clones the `Arc`,
/// incrementing the reference count. This means that unlike `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`, it will have
/// the `'static` lifetime.
///
/// As long as you have this guard, you have exclusive write access to the underlying `T`. The guard
/// internally keeps an `Arc` reference to the original rwlock and tracks the number of permits
/// acquired, so the original lock is maintained until this guard is dropped.
///
/// `OwnedMappedRwLockWriteGuard` implements [`Send`] and [`Sync`]
/// when the underlying data type supports these traits, allowing it to be used across task
/// boundaries and shared between threads safely.
