//! [`AtomicBox`] and [`AtomicOptionBox`] are safe, owning versions of std's [`AtomicPtr`].
//!
//! This can be useful to avoid resource leaks when you forget to call `Box::from_raw` on
//! the pointer stored in `AtomicPtr`.
//!
//! Unfortunately, the only operations you can perform on an atomic box are swaps and stores: you
//! can not just use the box without taking ownership of it. Imagine a `Box` without `Deref` or
//! `DerefMut` implementations, and you can get the idea. Still, this is sufficient for some
//! lock-free data structures, so here it is.
//!
//! ## Why no `Deref`?
//!
//! It would not be safe. The point of an `AtomicBox` is that other threads can obtain the boxed
//! value, take ownership of it, even drop it, all without taking a lock. So there is no safe way to
//! borrow that valueâ€”except to swap it out of the `AtomicBox` yourself.
//!
//! This is pretty much the same reason you can not borrow a reference to the contents of any other
//! atomic type. It would invite data races. The only difference here is that those contents happen
//! to be on the heap.
